title: 'madrat: May All Data be Reproducible and Transparent (MADRaT) *'
version: 3.16.0
date-released: '2025-01-08'
abstract: Provides a framework which should improve reproducibility and transparency
  in data processing. It provides functionality such as automatic meta data creation
  and management, rudimentary quality management, data caching, work-flow management
  and data aggregation. * The title is a wish not a promise. By no means we expect
  this package to deliver everything what is needed to achieve full reproducibility
  and transparency, but we believe that it supports efforts in this direction.
