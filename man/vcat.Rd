\title{Tool: Verbosity Cat}
\usage{
vcat(verbosity, ..., level = NULL, fill = TRUE, show_prefix = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{verbosity}{The lowest verbosity level for which this message should be
shown (verbosity = -1 means no information at all, 0 = only warnings, 1 =
warnings and execution information, 2 = full information). If the verbosity
is set to 0 the message is written as warning, if the verbosity is set
higher than 0 it is written as a normal cat message.}

\item{...}{The message to be shown}

\item{level}{This argument allows to establish a hierarchy of print
statements. The hierarchy is preserved for the next vcat executions.
Currently this setting can have 4 states: NULL (nothing will be changed), 0
(reset hierarchies), "+" (increase hierarchy level by 1) and "-" (decrease
hierarchy level by 1).}

\item{fill}{a logical or (positive) numeric controlling how the output is
broken into successive lines. If FALSE (default), only newlines created
explicitly by "\\n" are printed. Otherwise, the output is broken into lines
with print width equal to the option width if fill is TRUE, or the value of
fill if this is numeric. Non-positive fill values are ignored, with a warning.}

\item{show_prefix}{a logical defining whether a content specific prefix (e.g. "NOTE")
should be shown in front of the message or not. If prefix is not shown it will also
not show up in official statistics.}
