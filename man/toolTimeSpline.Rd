\title{Smooth a magclass time series with optional anchor years}
\usage{
toolTimeSpline(
  x,
  dof = 5,
  peggedYears = NULL,
  anchorFactor = 10,
  targetYears = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A magclass object.}

\item{dof}{Degrees-of-freedom per 100 years (higher -> more degrees of freedom,
less smoothing; default 5).}

\item{peggedYears}{Integer vector of years (e.g. `c(2020, 2050, 2100)`) to
anchor during smoothing; NULL for none (default).}

\item{anchorFactor}{Numeric multiplier for anchor weights (default 10);
larger values more strongly enforce pegging.}

\item{targetYears}{Integer vector of additional years at which the fitted spline
should be evaluated, enabling higher time resolution (default NULL, i.e. output
years equal input years). Output years are the sorted union of input and target years.}
}
\value{
A magclass object with each time series spline-smoothed.
  If targetYears is not specified (NULL), the time dimension is unchanged. If targetYears is
  given, the time dimension covers the sorted union of the original and target years.
}
\description{
Smooths a magclass time series using spline approximation with the given degrees
of freedom. Optionally, specific years can be "pegged" (anchored) to stay close
to their original values during smoothing. Anchoring is enforced by applying
high weights to those years. If a higher time resolution is desired,
the fitted spline can be evaluated at additional target years.
