Description: Provides a framework which should improve reproducibility and
    transparency in data processing. It provides functionality such as
    automatic meta data creation and management, rudimentary quality
    management, data caching, work-flow management and data aggregation.
    * The title is a wish not a promise. By no means we expect this
    package to deliver everything what is needed to achieve full
    reproducibility and transparency, but we believe that it supports
    efforts in this direction.
